# ImagePixel

First project on github using git. No judging bros (this includes female bros).

This Android App helps you pixelate images and then send them over bluetooth to an arduino with a neopixel 32x16 type of board (WS2812).

Upcoming fixes
- UI layout improvement
-- Remove useless buttons
-- graphical change
-- load pixel screen before bluetooth choice screen

Version 0.2

Added bluetooth connectivity

Current problems

- First column of picture is displayed on the 2nd column pushing the whole picture sideways by 1 column. the first column shows the last column.
- No comments in code at the moment (HIGH PRIORITY haha)



Version 0.1

Initial Commit
